Welcome to the xlsx wiki!

I'd like to use this facility to allow the community to contribute content that doesn't have to be part of the codebase.

Please feel free to add examples and advice here.  Also, if there's some content missing that you'd like, why not add a page with the word "**Wanted**" in the title?
